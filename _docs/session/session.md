@signature `feathersSession(baseConnect)`

Connects [can-connect/DataInterface] methods to the [feathers-authentication-client](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication-client) plugin methods for authentication.

```js
connect([
  feathersSession,
  realtime
], {
  feathersClient: feathersClient,
  Map: SessionMap
});
``` 

@body

The `feathers-session` behavior uses the [feathers-authentication-client](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication-client) to authenticate with a Feathers server.  Three of the [can-connect/DataInterface DataInterface] methods are used:

 - [can-connect-feathers/session/session.data-methods.createData createData] attempts to authenticate with the Feathers server, which upon success returns a JSON Web Token (JWT).  The JWT contains a payload with information about the current session.  That payload is returned as the session object.
 - [can-connect-feathers/session/session.data-methods.getData] validates a stored JWT and returns its payload if the token hasn't expired.
 - [can-connect-feathers/session/session.data-methods.destroyData] unauthenticates from the server and discards the JWT token on the client.

## Use

Setting up the Feathers Client is a prerequisite for using this behavior.  See the [can-connect-feathers] page for an example of a basic Feathers Client configuration.  With the Feathers client setup, it can be used with the `feathers-session` behavior as demonstrated in the example, below.

```js
// models/session.js
var connect = require('can-connect');
var DefineMap = require('can-define/map/');

var feathersSessionBehavior = require('can-connect-feathers/session');
var dataParse = require('can-connect/data/parse/');
var construct = require('can-connect/constructor/');
var constructStore = require('can-connect/constructor/store/');
var constructCallbacksOnce = require('can-connect/constructor/callbacks-once/');
var canMap = require('can-connect/can/map/');
var canRef = require('can-connect/can/ref/');
var dataCallbacks = require('can-connect/data/callbacks/');
// Bring in your user model to setup the relation in your DefineMap.
var User = require('./user');

// Bring in the feathersClient instance.
var feathersClient = require('./feathers');

export const Session = DefineMap.extend('Session', {
  seal: false
}, {
  exp: 'any',
  userId: 'any',
  user: {
    Type: User,
    // Automatically populate the user data when a userId is received.
    get (lastSetVal, resolve) {
      if (lastSetVal) {
        return lastSetVal;
      }
      if (this.userId) {
        User.get({_id: this.userId}).then(resolve);
      }
    }
  }
});

connect([
  // Include the feathers session behavior in the behaviors list.
  feathersSession,
  dataParse,
  canMap,
  canRef,
  construct,
  constructStore,
  constructCallbacksOnce,
  // Include the realtime behavior.
  realtime,
  dataCallbacks
], {
  // Pass the feathers client as the `feathersClient` property.
  feathersClient: feathersClient,
  idProp: 'exp',
  Map: Session,
  name: 'session'
});
```

### Obtaining current session data

Once authentication has been established, the Map or DefineMap provided as the `Map` option on the can-connect Model will have a new `current` property defined.  So, if you passed a `Session` object, `Session.current` will always hold the current session data.  This greatly simplifies the session property in your application ViewModel.  Here's an abbreviated example.

```js
import Session from 'my-app/models/session';

const AppViewModel = DefineMap.extend({
  session: {
    get () {
      return Session.current;
    }
  }
});
```

That's it!  The `session` property in the above example will automatically populate when the user authenticates.

### Handling OAuth Logins

The `feathers-session` behavior is preconfigured to listen to `login` messages coming in over the [feathers-authentication-popups](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-authentication-popups) `authAgent`.  When any message is received through the `authAgent`, its validity is checked.  If it's a valid JWT token, a Session instance will be created automatically.  This will both populate `Session.current` and dispatch a `created` event on the connected Session Map.
